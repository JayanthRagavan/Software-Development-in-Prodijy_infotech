Problem Statement: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as the outputs.

Procedure:

Enter temperature and unit, then click "Convert" for instant conversion.
View the converted temperature values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Optionally, reset the form to clear input fields and hide the result.
Repeat the process as needed for multiple temperature conversions.
Interface streamlines temperature conversions for quick and easy use.
